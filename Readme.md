**Simple cloud stack** is an initiative of building reusable cloud stack setups to build production-ready infrastructures quickly and with no hassle


Principles:

1. Setups may be very basic and simple however they should be secure.
2. Stable tools are preferred over trending ones.
3. Use NodeJS package managers (npm and yarn) to store and distribute setups.
